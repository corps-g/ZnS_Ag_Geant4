Literatures to model a Cf252 source.

The Cf source has 96.91% probability for alpha decay, with the alpha energy of
about 6.1 MeV. According to SRIM, the projected range of a 6.5-MeV alpha 
particle in air is 53.74 mm. Hence, in lab, to eliminate the alpha background, 
the source should be placed away from the detector about, e.g., 6cm.
