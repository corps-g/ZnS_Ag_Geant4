The gamma-rejection capabilities of the layered and the immersion detectors are
compared together. Hence, only one results processing script located in:
    /zsa_layer/run/gamma_reject/summary.
Remember to copy the immersion detector's results to the layer detectors' gamma-
reject results folder.
See /zsa_layer/run/gamma_reject/summary/process.py for naming details.
